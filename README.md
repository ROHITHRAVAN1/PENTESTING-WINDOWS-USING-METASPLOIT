# PENTESTING-WINDOWS-USING-METASPLOIT
HOW TO EXPLOIT THE VULNERABILITY IN WINDOWS USING THE METASPLOIT FRAME WORK
The aim of this project is to explore the hypothesis of a computer virus
threat, and how destructive it can be if executed on a targeted
machine. What are the possible counter measures to protect
computers from these threats? Information security risks associated
with computer viruses can infect computers and other storage devices
by copying themselves into a file and other executable programs. These
files get infection and allow attackers to connect to target systems by
using backdoors.
The results of this project show that, the proper security
implementations and the use of up to date operating systems patches
and anti-virus programs helps users to prevent the loss of data and any
viral attack on the system.
Nevertheless, this observation could be used for further research in the
network security and related fields; this study will also help computer
users to use the possible steps and techniques to protect their systems
and information from any possible attacks on their network systems.
SCOPE
The Internet today spans the globe and serves billions of users,
providing an environment in which a single virus can conceivably cause
rapid and widespread damage to systems throughout the world.
The scope of the project is to show the attacks possible on a computer
by spreading viruses by making them hang and unresponsive with
certain executable scripts and bash files and by adding them to auto
startup which leads to system crash and corrupting of hard drives and
also about the parameters have to be taken care to prevent such
attacks in this globalized world.
INTRODUCTION
Computer Virus is a program that copies itself; computer virus can
infect your computer and slowing down your computer. And virus also
can spread computer to computer. The person who sends out the
computer virus may use networking of the internet. The computer virus
also can be spread by via disk, CD, DVD or flash drive or other devices.
Usually, a virus is written to target a network file system or shared filet
in order to spread from computer to computer using network. Worm or
Trojan is slightly different from another virus it appears harmless; this is
the type of virus which enters the programs exploits security that may
have spread through other networks or Internet users.
Computer virus are usually small, which are design to spread from one
computer to other computer and to enter and interfere Computer
operation Virus might corrupt your windows or might delete the
important data on your computer, Normally virus can be spread
through e-mails program to other computer which can even delete
everything on the hard disk. Often Computer viruses can be spread by
attachments by e-mail messages or even can be instant massaging that
is why must never one a email which we don’t know where it came
from and who send it we may never know it could be virus. Virus can be
as attachments of funny images or video or files it can spread when u
download to your computer from the internet.
EXSISTING METHODS
There are so many methods hackers can get hold of our computer.
Some of them are easy to implement while some are difficult.
One method is by using Trojans. A Trojan is malware disguised as
harmless software, named after the wooden horse the ancient Greeks
used to trick their way into the city of Troy. The intent of the hacker is
to get you to install it by making you believe it’s safe. Once installed on 
your computer, a Trojan can do anything from logging your keystrokes,
to opening a backdoor and giving the hacker access to your system.
We have attacks by rootkits. A rootkit is not exactly malware like a virus
or Trojan. It is something much more insidious: a malicious segment of
code injected into your computer system, designed to hide any
unauthorized activity taking place. Since rootkits grant administrative
control to the attacker, your computer can be used without restrictions
and without your knowledge.
Anagram of Facebook, Koobface was a hybrid, or blended threat,
malware. It used the trickery aspect of a Trojan and the autonomously
replicating nature of a computer worm – a type of standalone virus that
does not need to attach itself to another program to spread the
infection. Koobface penetrated systems of unsuspecting Facebook
users by tricking them into believing they were clicking on a video. As in
other scams, hackers used the compromised account of a Facebook
friend by sending a private message through the Facebook platform.
This is a special type of an attack.
PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
FRAMEWORKS USED:
 METASPLOIT(configure handler and persistence backdoor)
 SHELLTER(bypass windows defender)
 APACHE SERVICE(file transferring )
 KALI LINUX DUAL BOOT WITH WINDOWS
 AUTOIT(auto run script generation)
 ngrok(for tunneling or port forwarding technique)
STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED
 Creating the payload of for the platform of our choice, here we
choose windows as platform
 Payload is embedded into any 32-bit software(as 32-bit run on
both 64-bit and 32-bit) by the shelter frame work
 Now we have to start apache service and upload our corrupted
software into it
 Now we make an zip file that contains the autoit script and an
image that will be displayed after the execution
 Send the zip file to target machine
 Setup a multi/handler in your pc to listen for incoming
connections
